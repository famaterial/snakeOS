Yes, it is possible to run a graphical Xorg environment through SSH and access another computer's screen using a feature called "X11 forwarding." X11 forwarding allows you to run graphical applications on a remote server while displaying the GUI on your local machine.

To enable X11 forwarding over SSH, you need to make sure that both the SSH client (your local machine) and the SSH server (the remote machine) are configured properly.

Here's how you can do it:

1. **Install necessary packages:**
   On your local machine (SSH client), you need an X11 server installed. Most Linux distributions have this by default. For Windows, you can use Xming or VcXsrv. On the remote machine (SSH server), you need the X11 server installed as well. Additionally, ensure that the `xauth` package is installed on both the client and server systems.

2. **Enable X11 forwarding in SSH:**
   On the client side, you can enable X11 forwarding using the `-X` or `-Y` option when you connect via SSH. The `-X` option is for trusted X11 forwarding, while `-Y` is for untrusted (safer) X11 forwarding.

   ```
   ssh -X user@remote_server_ip
   ```

   or

   ```
   ssh -Y user@remote_server_ip
   ```

3. **Run graphical applications:**
   After you establish the SSH connection with X11 forwarding enabled, you can run graphical applications on the remote server, and their windows will be displayed on your local machine.

   For example, you can run a graphical application like `gedit`:

   ```
   gedit
   ```

   The graphical window of `gedit` will appear on your local machine.

Please note that X11 forwarding may not be as performant as running the applications directly on your local machine, especially if the network connection is slow or unstable. Additionally, enabling X11 forwarding allows the remote server to access your local X11 display, which could potentially be a security risk if you are connecting to an untrusted server. Always use X11 forwarding with caution and only with trusted servers.

If you need better performance or more security, you can consider using alternative solutions like VNC (Virtual Network Computing) or Remote Desktop protocols, depending on your specific requirements.
